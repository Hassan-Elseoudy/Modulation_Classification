# Problem Statement
### DeepSig Dataset: RadioML 2016.04C

A synthetic dataset, generated with GNU Radio, consisting of 11 modulations. This is a
variable-SNR dataset with moderate LO drift, light fading, and numerous different
labeled SNR increments for use in measuring performance across different signal and
noise power scenarios.

### Objective
Classify signals using CNN and ANN: and illustarte how SNR helps in signal classification.
